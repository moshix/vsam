# VSAM Tutorial

This repository contains sample JCL and Cobol programs to show how to use VSAM.


These jobs will work as-is on MVS 3.8 TK4- Update 8 (and probably earlier and later updates.


Furthermore, there is also an assembler program which reads in a sequential dataset 
and writes the content to a VSAM KSDS cluster, as a boilerplate. It will assemble on 
MVS ASMFX assembler and on the modern HLASM.
